She was also very thorough in remembering what we discussed after every phone call and email. She definitely brought our vision to life with such ease and catered to our needs the whole time. She was also so generous to meet with us whenever we had to go through some urgent matters and help answer any questions! If we had to be more specific about the work she did, we were having weather challenges, she was extremely helpful, cooperative and flexible even if we had to move the venue in the last minute. Both, my husband and I loved our decoration and were very happy to see it all come together after months of planning!",
